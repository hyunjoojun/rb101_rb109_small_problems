# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# Input: An Array
# Output: An Integer

# Rules:
# In the given array, there is only one number that is unique.
# All other numbers are equal.
# Return the number that is unique.
# Array has more than 3 numbers.

# Iterate through the numbers.
# Find the number that has count of 1.
# Return the number.
